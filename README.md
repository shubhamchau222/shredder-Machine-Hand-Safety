## What is Shredder Machine and How it looks Like ?


```bash 
    An industrial shredder is a piece of heavy duty equipment designed to shred dense and light materials to prepare them 
    for recycling or for the destruction of unusable products. They are an environmentally sound device that takes otherwise
    useless materials and transforms them into raw forms for remanufacturing or  waste management.
    Industrial shredders vary from office equipment designed to destroy sensitive documents to huge commercial industrial 
    shredders that prepare materials for disposal or recycling. In recent years, shredders have become an essential part of 
    manufacturing and production as an assist to helping reduce the amount of waste dumped into landfills.
